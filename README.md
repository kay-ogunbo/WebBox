THIS IS THE ARCHIVE OF THE ORIGINAL WEBWAREBOX PROJECT. IT'S PURPOSE IS FOR HISTORIC-PURPOSES. BUT, IT'S MAIN REASON IS FOR ALLOWING OTHERS TO CREATE FORKS
OF THE ORIGINAL PROJECT, FOR WHATEVER PURPOSE.

YOU CANNOT CONTRIBUTE TO THIS REPOSITORY. IF YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE, PLEASE CREATE YOUR OWN FORK OR CONTRIBUTE TO AN EXISITNG FORK.

THANKS.

(**NOTE TO FORK-OWNERS: PLEASE MODIFY THIS FILE TO SUIT YOUR FORK OF THE PROJECT.**)

(**NOTE2: THE ORIGINAL PROJECT, HAD A LOT OF UNFINISHED THINGS IN IT. SO, PLEASE. IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A FORK. MAKE SURE YOU COMPLETE ANYTHING THAT MAY BE 
UNFINISHED AND ALSO ADD MISSING FEATURES(*LIKE REGISTRATION*)**)
