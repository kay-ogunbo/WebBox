# WebWareBox - Archive
THIS IS THE ARCHIVE OF THE ORIGINAL WEBWAREBOX PROJECT. IT'S PURPOSE IS FOR HISTORIC-PURPOSES. BUT, IT'S MAIN REASON IS FOR ALLOWING OTHERS TO CREATE FORKS
OF THE ORIGINAL PROJECT, FOR WHATEVER PURPOSE.

YOU CANNOT CONTRIBUTE TO THIS REPOSITORY. IF YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE, PLEASE CREATE YOUR OWN FORK OR CONTRIBUTE TO AN EXISITNG FORK.

THANKS

(**NOTE TO FORK-OWNERS: PLEASE MODIFY THIS FILE TO SUIT YOUR FORK OF THE PROJECT.**)
